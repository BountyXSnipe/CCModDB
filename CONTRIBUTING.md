# Database Guidelines
## Constraints

	- You aren't required to use its feature set, the requirement is to be compatible with the aforementioned modloader.

## Mod structure
- The entrypoint for all mods is `mod.js`. This file **must** exist and be located in the root directory of the repository.

## Database structure
- All mods will be added as submodules.

## How to add your mod
Use the pull request feature for an submodule update or for new mod integrations.
